logseq-live-math integrates [MathLive](https://cortexjs.io/mathlive/) into Logseq, providing a better experience using Logseq with a lot of math.

> The above video is accelerated. Some shortcuts in the video are [customized](https://github.com/AllanChain/logseq-live-math/discussions/14).
> It also uses [logseq-display-math](https://github.com/AllanChain/logseq-display-math) to render inline math in display style.

## Features

- ‚å®Ô∏è Easy and convenient ways to trigger the MathLive input
  1. Using <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd> shortcut. Can rebind in Logseq settings

     It's recommended because it can both
     - create new math
     - edit existing math (just by placing input caret inside the math expression)
  2. Using the `/math` command
  3. Type `$$`. Can be disabled
  4. Select existing formula with the mouse (e.g. `$\frac12$`). Can be disabled
- üìù Edit LaTeX formula with MathLive, rich, intuitive, and fast
- üîÑ Update the LaTeX formula in the block in real-time
- üîô Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to confirm
- üé® Well-configured MathLive theme to match Logseq custom theme
- üîß Configurable MathLive [keybindings](https://cortexjs.io/mathlive/guides/shortcuts/#key-bindings) and [inline shortcuts](https://cortexjs.io/mathlive/guides/shortcuts/#inline-shortcuts)

## Install

This plugin is available on the plugin marketplace. The simplest way to install it is from the marketplace.

You can also download the `zip` file under the [release](https://github.com/AllanChain/logseq-live-math/releases/latest) page, unzip it somewhere and Click `Load unpacked plugin`, and select the folder where the plugin code was unzipped. You may need to go to "Settings -> Advanced" to enable "Developer mode".

## FAQ

### How is this plugin different from the `darwis-mathlive-plugin`?

[darwis-mathlive-plugin](https://github.com/hkgnp/darwis-mathlive-plugin) also integrated MathLive to Logseq, but it‚Äôs working in a different way which is not very convenient for me, as it‚Äôs not automatically converted to LaTeX and only supports display math.

### How to disable the double-dollar trigger and select-and-edit?

Go to the settings page and disable them.

For select-and-edit, it's also possible to require a modifier key to be pressed.
For example, if you configured the key to be <kbd>Shift</kbd>, then you need to hold the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key while selecting, so that the popup will show. If not holding the key, nothing will happen.

### How to switch between display math (`$$`) and inline math (`$`)?

If you want to change the default style, go to the settings page and switch `preferDisplay`.

If you need to switch temporarily, you can click on the title of the popup to switch between `Inline Math` and `Display Math`. There is also a keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>$</kbd> (e.g. with US layout, it's <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>4</kbd>) which does the same job.

Besides, there is `smartFormat` option, which will choose prefered style according to the context. You can disable it if you don't like it.

### How to configure keybindings and inline shortcuts?

If you clicked "Edit settings.json", you will notice this plugin comes with some examples.
You can also read the [MathLive documentation](https://cortexjs.io/mathlive/guides/shortcuts/) to learn more.

And don't forget to check out the [GitHub Discussion thread](https://github.com/AllanChain/logseq-live-math/discussions/14)!
You are encouraged to share your configs there!

### How can I input `align` / `split` etc.?

If you are using <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>, you will find that MathLive doesn't handle this well (see [#21](https://github.com/AllanChain/logseq-live-math/issues/21)).

As a workaround, you can create an inline shortcut:

```json5
"align": "\\begin{align*}\n#? &= #? \\\\\n #? &= #?\\end{align*}",
```

After typing "align", something like this will show
